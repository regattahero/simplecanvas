# SimpleCanvas

A small, zero-dependency browser sketching canvas.

Demo: https://oldwired.github.io/simplecanvas/

Open `index.html` in a browser to draw, add shapes or text, and save or load sketches as JSON.

The shape library is optional. Select canvas objects and choose **Add selection to library…**
from the menu, or choose **Import library…** to open your own library file. The library button
appears once a library is available. Click a shape to place it; **Manage** lets you rename,
delete, or replace a shape with the current canvas selection. Images cannot be included.

**Export library…** downloads the entire active library as `shapes-library.json`. Library
changes last only for the current visit and are separate from sketch saves and autosave.
An indicator shows unexported changes; importing another library or leaving the page warns
before those changes are discarded. Import your exported file to use it on another visit.

When hosted, an optional `shapes-library.json` beside the HTML supplies the initial library.
It is read only once at startup. Opening the picker never reloads it, and custom file imports
work whether the page is hosted or opened locally. The HTML works on its own without this file.
